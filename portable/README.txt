Portable Tech Support Bro
===========================

Files in this folder are ready for offline use.

How to launch:
1. Open index.html in your browser for the standard landing page.
2. Open tech_support_landing.html for the alternative Codex view.

Tips:
- Leave all files together; the app loads fonts, videos, and knowledge base from this same folder.
- For the best experience, open the HTML files in a Chromium-based browser (Edge, Chrome) with local file access enabled.
- To update the offline knowledge base, run `npm run build-kb` then `npm run portable` from the project root.
